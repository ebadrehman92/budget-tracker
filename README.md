# budget-tracker

DESCRIPTION

This application is a demo of my abilities to cache client-side files for accessability.

This application shows a budget graph, and it gives users the option to create transactions that add or subtract from the total. These transactions are stored if offline, and are added back once network coverage resumes.

DEPENDENCIES

This application uses the following to deploy and run:
-Express
-IdexDB
-Mongoose
-Node
-Heroku
-MongoAtlas
